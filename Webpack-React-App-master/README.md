# Webpack-React-App
### webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.(Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a brand new version of your code.)
